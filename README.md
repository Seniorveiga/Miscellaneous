## [Project: ASCII Art Generator with my favourite cars!](https://github.com/Seniorveiga/Miscellaneous)

I am a huge fan of arts and cars, and I decided to make something different just to have a funy weekend at home. In addition, I have learn a bit of some packages doing this project. Some of the things that I have learnt are:
* Establish a **inyective function** between images of color and withour color.
* Create a program of less than 20 lines to convert photos from color to black and white â¬›ðŸ”³â¬œ
* Usage of packages related with images such as *ImageDraw* or *ImageFont*.
* Create a **biyective** relationship between *ASCII code* and *Black and White* density.
* Use ImageDraw.Draw to write over an image.

> To show you more about me, I have done this project with two of my favourite cars! The *Honda NSX from 1989* and the *Porsche 911 Targa*, here I leave you the results!
